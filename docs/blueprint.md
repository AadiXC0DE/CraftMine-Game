# **App Name**: Block Explorer

## Core Features:

- Terrain Generation: Generate an infinitely random 3D terrain composed of cube blocks using a procedural generation algorithm.
- User Movement: Enable the user to navigate the 3D environment using mouse and 'WASD' keys.
- Sky Rendering: Display a skybox with a sun.
- Trees Generation: Generate trees, wood blocks and green blocks on top of the terrain, each tree being different and randomly generated.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Mid-tone green (#70AD47) to evoke a sense of natural landscapes and block textures.
- Background color: Very light desaturated green (#F0F4EC) creates a gentle backdrop for the colorful block terrain.
- Accent color: Yellow-green (#92D050) is used sparingly to highlight interactive elements, or specific block areas.
- Sans-serif font should be used, providing a modern and readable interface.
- Minimalist UI with an unobtrusive layout to maximize the 3D world view.
- Smooth camera movements and transitions to enhance the sense of exploration.
